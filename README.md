# sloraris.dev

This is the source code for my personal website, [sloraris.dev](https://sloraris.dev). It's a static site with some automations for managing projects/posts and site deployment.

## Development

This site is built with Astro and uses Tailwind and DaisyUI. The dev server can be started using the `pnpm run dev` command. The site is deployed to Github Pages using astro's Github Action.

This site started as a template, but has been heavily modified and stripped-down to fit my needs. Notable modifications include the following:
- Custom brand/style guide
- Custom animations and hover-states
- Custom TopNav and MobileNav
- Custom 404 page (with stellar animation)
- Custom skill bars component
- Custom timeline object component
- Custom page layouts
