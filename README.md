# sloraris.dev

This is the source code for my personal website, [sloraris.dev](https://sloraris.dev). It's a static site with some custom components and a custom backend for managing the projects and blog posts.

## Development

This site is built with Astro, using the `pnpm run dev` command to start the dev server. The site is then deployed to Github Pages using astro's Github Action.
