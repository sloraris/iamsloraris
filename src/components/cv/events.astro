  I grew up fascinated by helicopters. My time in the Idaho Army National Guard allowed me to learn how they function and participate in their maintenance. I met some amazing people and learned a lot about working in a team environment, leading and training new soldiers, and the importance of attention to detail.

  I learned firsthand how to build and maintain a website while working for the USU IT Web Team. Decisions on how to style and format pages while balancing client needs, technical constraints, and website best practices were challenging but rewarding.

  Working for the IT Security team at Utah State University introduced me to the world of cybersecurity. I got to use tools like NMAP, Nessus, SentinelOne, Abnormal, and others to check the security of various systems and networks. I also got to learn about different types of attacks and how to defend against them. I learned a lot about network security, system hardening, and incident response.

  I spent 2 years in the California Oakland Mission speaking English. My time was spent serving others and teaching people about Jesus Christ. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the importance of faith, hope, and charity. It also taught me a lot about communication and how to communicate with people from all walks of life, as well as patience during times of trouble (like COVID-19).

  This is where my interest in electricity began. I spent 6 months learning about the theory and physics of how electricity works and how to troubleshoot it both generally and on aircraft. My training certified me to work on the UH-60 Blackhawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters.

  I spent 10 weeks learning basic infantry skills and tactics as well as army history and the army lifestyle. This was a fairly grueling process, but I learned a lot about discipline, teamwork, leadership, and just how much I'm physically and mentally capable of.

  I graduated from Woodbury High School in 2017. I was a member of the FRC robotics team (Team 3206) where I mainly focused on team synergy as a lead robot operator, but spent a lot of time on the planning and design side of things as well.
