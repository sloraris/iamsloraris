I’m Parker Owings, and while I’m not building the next social media empire, I am deep in the trenches of networking, DevOps, and turning my homelab into a glorified experiment zone. Whether I’m automating my servers or trying not to break my home network (again), this is where I share my misadventures and occasional successes. Come for the portfolio, stay for the troubleshooting logs.';
